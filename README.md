# Dice-Game
A website game developed by JS

GAME RULES:

The game has 2 players in rounds.
In each turn a player rolls a dice as many times as he wants;
and each result gets added this ROUND score.

BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost;
after that, it's the next player's turn.
The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to
his GLOBAL score.

After that, it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 25 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
